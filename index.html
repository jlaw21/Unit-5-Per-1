    <h1>Headers</h1>
    <p>Headers are used to create page titles and section headers. There are 6 different sizes pre-formatted for HTML.</p>
    <h1>h1 - Computer Science</h1>
    <h2>h2 - Computer Science</h2>
    <h3>h3 - Computer Science</h3>
    <h4>h4 - Computer Science</h4>
    <h5>h5 - Computer Science</h5>
    <h6>h6 - Computer Science</h6>

    <h1 style="color: #f4d160">Text Formatting</h1>
    <p>There are three main types of text formatting. Those are: <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underline</u>.</p>

    <h2>Block Elements vs. Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph element is a block element. Each paragraph will start on a new line. An <b>inline element</b> does not move to a new line. It keeps its content on the same line as previous content. The bold, italics and underline elements are all inline elements.</p>

    <h3><u>Block Example</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This another paragraph. It makes a new block on a new line.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element.<p>This is the paragraph inside the first paragraph.</p></p>

    <h3><u>Inline Example</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>bold</b>.</p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A line break move the content down to a new line. Its similar to pressing the enter key in a Word/Google document. A horizontal rule is a line break with a horizontal bar across the page. Both are block elements.</p>

    <p>Below this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #f4d160">Attributes</h1>
    <p><b>Attributes</b> are properties which can change an HTML element. Attributes are written in the header tag of ANY html element. The most common attributes are <i>class</i>, <i>id</i>, and <i>style.</i></p>

    <h2>Inline CSS Styles</h2>
    <p>The <i>style</i> attribute allows you to add CSS styles to an HTML document.</p>

    <p style="color:red;">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the color to red.</p>

    <p style="background-color: slategrey;">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the background to yellow.</p>

    <p style="color:slategray;background-color:lightsteelblue;">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the font color <b>AND</b> background color.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Jokerman">This paragraph changes the font type.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 36px;">This paragraph has a 36 px font size.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #fbeeac; color:#8ac4d0; font-family: 'Edwardian Script ITC'; font-size: 48px">This paragraph has all 4 inline styles.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #f4d160">Images</h1>

    <p>An <b>image element</b> is an <i>inline</i> element which inserts pictures into the document. An image element is self-closing, which means it does not have a closing tag. It has one attribute, src, which is a filepath that points to the image location. Those filepaths can be either <b>absolute</b> or <b>relative</b>.</p>

    <h2>Simple Image Example</h2>
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3225517/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" >

    <h2>Image Attributes</h2>
    <p>There are 4 attributes commonly used for images. <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are used to resize the images. <i>alt</i> allows to use text-descriptions of images for accessibility and broken images. <i>title</i> allows a hover-over effect and is used in place of <i>alt</i> if there isn't one.</p>

    <h3>Width and Height</h3>
    <p>The width and height can be measured in many different ways, but more common ones are pixels and percentages. Using pixels, you set the specific, precise size based on pixels. Using percentages, you set the dimensions based on a percentage of the entire page. Percentage re-sizing will often respect aspect ratio while using pixels may not.</p>
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3225517/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" width="150px" height="400px" title="set width and height using pixels">
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3225517/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" width="150px" title="set width and height using pixels and maintaining aspect ratio">
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3225517/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" width="50%" title="set width using percentage and maintaining aspect ratio">

    <h3>Alt Attribute</h3>
    <p>EVERY picture should at LEAST have the alt attribute. The alt attribute helps with screen readers for visually impaired user and in the cases that the image is broken.</p>

    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" width="150px" alt="picture of river running through taiga and mountains.">
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" width="150px" title="picture of river running through taiga and mountains.">

    <h2>Relative vs. Absolute</h2>
    <p>An <b>absolute</b> filepath includes all the navigate to get to the server, folders and file. The examples above are all absolute filepaths. An absolute filepath is used when the image is stored on a different server or device than the HTML document. </p>

    <p>A <b>relative</b> filepath only include the folder and file. The examples below are all relative filepaths. A relative filepath is used when the images are stored alongside the HTML document.</p>

    <img src="deer.jpg" width="50%" alt="deer silhouette at sunset">
