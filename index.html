    <h1>Headers</h1>
    <p>Headers are used to create page titles and section headers. There are 6 different sizes pre-formatted for HTML.</p>
    <h1 style="color:black;">h1 - Computer Science</h1>
    <h2>h2 - Computer Science</h2>
    <h3>h3 - Computer Science</h3>
    <h4>h4 - Computer Science</h4>
    <h5>h5 - Computer Science</h5>
    <h6>h6 - Computer Science</h6>

    <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
    <p>There are three main types of text formatting. Those are: <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underline</u>.</p>

    <h2>Block Elements vs. Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph element is a block element. Each paragraph will start on a new line. An <b>inline element</b> does not move to a new line. It keeps its content on the same line as previous content. The bold, italics and underline elements are all inline elements.</p>

    <h3><u>Block Example</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This another paragraph. It makes a new block on a new line.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element.<p>This is the paragraph inside the first paragraph.</p></p>

    <h3><u>Inline Example</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>bold</b>.</p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A line break move the content down to a new line. Its similar to pressing the enter key in a Word/Google document. A horizontal rule is a line break with a horizontal bar across the page. Both are block elements.</p>

    <p>Below this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>

    <h1>Attributes</h1>
    <p><b>Attributes</b> are properties which can change an HTML element. Attributes are written in the header tag of ANY html element. The most common attributes are <i>class</i>, <i>id</i>, and <i>style.</i></p>

    <h2>Inline CSS Styles</h2>
    <p>The <i>style</i> attribute allows you to add CSS styles to an HTML document.</p>

    <p style="color:red;">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the color to red.</p>

    <p style="background-color: slategrey;">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the background to yellow.</p>

    <p style="color:slategray;background-color:lightsteelblue;">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the font color <b>AND</b> background color.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Jokerman">This paragraph changes the font type.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 36px;">This paragraph has a 36 px font size.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #fbeeac; color:#8ac4d0; font-family: 'Edwardian Script ITC'; font-size: 48px">This paragraph has all 4 inline styles.</p>

    <h1>Images</h1>

    <p>An <b>image element</b> is an <i>inline</i> element which inserts pictures into the document. An image element is self-closing, which means it does not have a closing tag. It has one attribute, src, which is a filepath that points to the image location. Those filepaths can be either <b>absolute</b> or <b>relative</b>.</p>

    <h2>Simple Image Example</h2>
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3225517/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" >

    <h2>Image Attributes</h2>
    <p>There are 4 attributes commonly used for images. <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are used to resize the images. <i>alt</i> allows to use text-descriptions of images for accessibility and broken images. <i>title</i> allows a hover-over effect and is used in place of <i>alt</i> if there isn't one.</p>

    <h3>Width and Height</h3>
    <p>The width and height can be measured in many different ways, but more common ones are pixels and percentages. Using pixels, you set the specific, precise size based on pixels. Using percentages, you set the dimensions based on a percentage of the entire page. Percentage re-sizing will often respect aspect ratio while using pixels may not.</p>
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3225517/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" width="150px" height="400px" title="set width and height using pixels">
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3225517/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" width="150px" title="set width and height using pixels and maintaining aspect ratio">
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3225517/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" width="50%" title="set width using percentage and maintaining aspect ratio">

    <h3>Alt Attribute</h3>
    <p>EVERY picture should at LEAST have the alt attribute. The alt attribute helps with screen readers for visually impaired user and in the cases that the image is broken.</p>
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" width="150px">
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" width="150px" alt="picture of river running through taiga and mountains.">
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/pexels-photo-3225517.jpeg" width="150px" title="picture of river running through taiga and mountains.">

    <h2>Relative vs. Absolute</h2>
    <p>An <b>absolute</b> filepath includes all the navigate to get to the server, folders and file. The examples above are all absolute filepaths. An absolute filepath is used when the image is stored on a different server or device than the HTML document. </p>

    <p>A <b>relative</b> filepath only include the folder and file. The examples below are all relative filepaths. A relative filepath is used when the images are stored alongside the HTML document.</p>

    <img src="deer.jpg" width="50%" alt="deer silhouette at sunset">

    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>The <b>anchor element</b> is an <i>inline element</i> and is a way to include hypertext links, otherwise known as just links, in your document. An anchor is a reference point for other documents or files. It commonly has 3 attributes: <i>href</i>, <i>target</i> and <i>download.</i></p>

    <h2>Simple Link</h2>
    <a href="https://www.webhamster.com/">LINK</a>
    <p>In order for a link to work is <b>MUST</b> include the <i>href</i> attribute. This attribute is the filepath, either absolute or relative, to the document, website or file you wish to link.</p>

    <h2>Links Attributes</h2>
    <p>The <i>target</i> attribute allows you to decide where the link opens. There are 4 options, but only one is commonly used. <i>_blank</i> opens the linked document in a new window or tab. <i>_self</i> opens the link in the current window or tab. This is the default behavior. The two others are only used if you have a frame or other window INSIDE a window. We will not be discussing these.</p>

    <a href="https://www.webhamster.com/" target="_blank">This link will open in a new tab.</a>

    <p>The <i>download</i> attribute allows you to download the file or document linked. This is commonly used only with relative filepaths.</p>

    <a href="deer.jpg" download="deerPic">This link will download a deer picture.</a>

    <h2>A Picture as a Link</h2>
    <p>Since a link has an opening AND closing tag, we can place ANY HTML ELEMENT as its content, which includes pictures. We simply nest the img element inside the anchor element.</p>

    <a href="https://www.webhamster.com/" target="_blank">
        <img src="deer.jpg" title="A picture as a link" alt="deer in a meadow at sundown" width="150px">
    </a>

    <h2>Link to Another Page</h2>

    <h1>Lists</h1>
    <p>There are two main types of lists. An <b>unordered list</b> is a bulleted list of items. An <b>ordered list</b> is a numbered list of items. In an ordered list, the style of the list can be altered using attributes <i>list-style-type</i> and <i>type</i>. You can also change the order and numbering of an ordered list by using the attributes <i>start</i>, <i>reversed</i> and <i>value</i>.</p>

    <h2>Simple Lists</h2>
    <p>A list is a container with items nested in it.</p>
    <p>This is an unordered list: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a list item.</li>
        <li>This is another list item.</li>
        <li>This is yet another list item.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is an ordered list:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>This is a list item.</li>
        <li>This is another list item.</li>
        <li>This is yet another list item.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>List Attributes</h2>

    <p>An unordered list only has ONE attribute, <i>list-style-type</i>. It can have values of <i>disc (default)</i>, <i>circle</i>, <i>square</i> and <i>none</i>.</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
        <li>This is a list item.</li>
        <li>This is another list item.</li>
        <li>This is yet another list item.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>An ordered list has multiple attributes broken into two sets. The first set of attributes determines the type of numbering to use. The second set determines values for the items in the set.</p>
    <p>The attribute <i>type</i> determines what numbering system to use. There are 4 different types: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>type = 1, number (default)</li>
        <li>type = A, uppercase letters</li>
        <li>type = a, lowercase letters</li>
        <li>type = I, uppercase Roman numerals</li>
        <li>type = i, lowercase Roman numerals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This ordered list uses uppercase Roman numberals.</p>

    <ol type="I">
        <li>This is a list item.</li>
        <li>This is another list item.</li>
        <li>This is yet another list item.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The attributes <i>start</i> and <i>value</i> can change the numbering of the list. <i>start</i> changes where the numbers begin and <i>value</i> changes a specific list item to a chosen value.</p>

    <p>This ordered list is starting at 5, but the middle item will have a value of 10.</p>

    <ol start="5">
        <li>This is a list item.</li>
        <li value="10">This is another list item.</li>
        <li>This is yet another list item.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Lastly, the <i>reversed</i> attribute makes the numbering go backwards.</p>

    <ol start="10" type = "A" reversed>
        <li>This is a list item.</li>
        <li>This is another list item.</li>
        <li>This is yet another list item.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nested Lists</h2>

    <p>Like all things in HTML, we can put lists inside of lists.</p>
